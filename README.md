# Example Package

This is a simple example package. You can use
[GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
to write your content.

The structure and everything is correct but package names cannot have hyphen.
Due to this the package is unusable.
Don't bother using the package.
